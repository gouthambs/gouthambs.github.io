Now we are mostly
finished with the content of the book. The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://leanpub.com/quantlibpythoncookbook"&gt;new version of the book&lt;/a&gt; is
out, and those who bought a previous version can now log into LeanPub to download the new version of the book and the
accompanying python code in the form of notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This version includes some content update and preliminary support for Python 3. We are working to convert
IPython notebooks into Jupyter notebooks and that will be the next release milestone for the book. You
should expect to hear from us in about a month or so.&lt;/p&gt;
